Predicting property and casualty insurance claims: A Machine Learning Approach

Abstract:

Property and Casualty insurance companies often encounter problems in predicting the likelihood of a policyholder causing a claim. 
Some territories have few claim experiences, resulting in very sparse data. In addition, some data are highly dimensional in terms
of the predictors of the likelihood of a claim. 

In this research, simulated sparse claims data are used to identify the most appropriate predictive model for determining the likelihood
of a policyholder causing a claim. Machine learning algorithms such as the logit model and the support vector machine will be used to 
predict whether the future policyholder will incur a claim.
